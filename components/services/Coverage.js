                                  A good starting place for determining how much
                                  coverage you need is to add up any financial
                                  responsibilities your loved ones would be left
                                  with. That could include the cost of a
                                  funeral, childcare, a mortgage, college
                                  education, outstanding debts or other everyday
                                  expenses. Your coverage amounts should account
                                  for things you currently pay for or know you
                                  will be paying for in the future
